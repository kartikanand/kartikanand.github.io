Hello! I'm Kartik Anand, a software engineer from [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), India. I'm currently working with [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) on the [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) browser team. Previously, I worked with [Synopsys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synopsys), contributing to the development of two synthesis engines.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in engineering from [Punjab Engineering College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Engineering_College), Chandigarh, and a Master's degree in Computer sciences from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new frameworks and technologies and creating small projects hosted on Github. You can check out some of my projects on my website or visit my [Github profile](https://github.com/kartikanand/) for more. I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in tech and push the boundaries.

When I need a break from coding, you can find me either cooking up a storm in the kitchen, catching up on my favorite TV shows or movies. Cooking is an art form that I believe brings people together, just like coding does.

That's a little bit about me! Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat.
