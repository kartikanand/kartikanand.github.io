> Perhaps the worst will happen, perhaps not, until then, look forward to better things.  
>   
> Seneca  

> You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.  

> What if it rains ?  
> Then we’ll get wet  

> To be nobody but yourself — in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you somebody else — means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting.

> Marcus Aurelius  

> It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.

> Dale Carnegie

> All men must step into the unknown, there and only there in the annihilation of hate and anger, and ego is our salvation.  

> Objective judgement, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance - now at this very moment - of all external events.  
> That’s all you need.  
>   
> Marcus Aurelius  

> Don’t seek, but allow.  
> Do not seek it, for it will come when least expected.

> This bridge will only take you halfway there  
> To those mysterious lands you long to see:  
> Through gypsy camps and swirling Arab fairs  
> And moonlit woods where unicorns run free.  
> So come and walk awhile with me and share  
> The twisting trails and wondrous worlds I’ve known.  
> But this bridge will only take you halfway there-  
> The last few steps you’ll have to take alone.  
>   
>  Shel Silverstein  

> She had blue skin,  
> And so did he.  
> He kept it hid  
> And so did she.

> Their whole life through,  
> Then passed right by-  
> And never knew.  
>   
> Shel Silverstein

> ANYTHING can be

> The Voice  
>   
> There is a voice inside of you  
> that whispers all day long,

> I know that this is wrong.’  
> No teacher, preacher, parent, friend  
> or wise man can decide  
> what’s right for you - just listen to  
> the voice that speaks inside.  
>   
> Shel Silverstein  

> When I am gone what will you do?  
> Who will write and draw for you?  
> Someone smarter—someone new?  
> Someone better—maybe YOU!  
>   
> Shel Silverstein
