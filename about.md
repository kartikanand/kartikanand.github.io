# About Me

Hey there !

I’m Kartik Anand from Delhi, India. For my day job, I work on logic synthesis tools. I’m currently employed with Synopsys Inc. Logic Synthesis refers to the process of converting HDL (Hardware description languages) to gate level net list, in a sense, synthesis tools are your compilers for Verilog, VHDL, and System Verilog family of languages.

I like to make silly side projects from time to time, particularly to learn new programming languages, web frameworks, and interesting programming paradigms (Currently dabbling with Rust)
