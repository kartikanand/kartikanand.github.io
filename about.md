# About Me

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hsmcR.jpg?s=328&g=1){: .center-image }

Hey there !

Iâ€™m Kartik Anand from [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), India. Currently, I'm a first year graduate student in the department of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). I'm broadly interested in the fields of *Computer Architecture*, *Systems*, and *Compilers*, so basically the nitty gritties of how a computer system works.

Before coming here, I was employed with [Synopsys Inc.](https://www.synopsys.com) where I worked on developing [logic synthesis tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_synthesis). Logic Synthesis refers to the process of converting HDL (Hardware description languages) to gate level net list, in a sense, synthesis tools are your compilers for Verilog, VHDL, and System Verilog family of languages.

I like to make small fully contained side projects from time to time, particularly to learn new programming languages, web frameworks, and interesting programming paradigms. This website is a place to host and show off my silly side projects, and write on things that people may find interesting and helpful.

You may contact me through the below mentioned links:

This website is a modified version of [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) theme for Jekyll and is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
